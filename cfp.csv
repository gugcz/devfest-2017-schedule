PWA sounds like a new framework, or a tool to create some sort of web apps. Many developers link it to JavaScript, and that is only achievable with one of those new framework.js out there.

I’ve been wondering about the truth of this previous statement, can we create a PWA in, let’s say, pure Java? I did some research and I’m going to present my findings.

In this presentation I will demonstrate how we can actually build modern web applications that qualify as ""Progressive Web Apps"".

It feels like you are being put through an exam. Often, we forget we are also evaluating the company we are interviewing with, especially when we start interviewing for the first time, and it is hard to know what to look for.

On the other hand, interviewing candidates for a position can be stressful too. You want to find the perfect person to join your team, but there are many factors that feel out of our hands (e.g. rain can affect the mood of the candidate and the person interviewing and impact the result). We need to effectively control the factors that we can.

With this talk we want to focus on the whole process of finding the right people to work with, from the job advert to the offer. And we want to do it from both points of view, as the company and as the candidate.

We want to show candidates behind the scenes of the interviewing process, to make it feel less intimidating. We want to teach them how to choose a job and a company that fits with them. We want to give some tips on how to prepare for interviews, and the sort of exercises they might encounter.

We also want to help companies improve their hiring process. There is no solution that works for everyone, but there are patterns everyone can follow to do better. We want to show them how to reach candidates, make sure qualified candidates apply, show them how to deal with the unavoidable biases they will face, help them understand the pros and cons of different types of  exercises, and finally, help them find the perfect new hire for their team.

Hiring and interviewing is not easy, and there is no easy solution to it.

But as app session lasts around 5 minutes, there’s a large portion of the day where your app is not being used. When your app is sound asleep what can you do to remind your users that your app is the best? 
This talk will explore how to make your app pop and shine, even when is not on the foreground, and increase retention dramatically! Brand new Android O features, notifications, shortcuts, animated launcher icons.. Your app won’t be sleeping for long ;)

But there is a number of reasons why backend of the React application (in my opinion) is better when it’s developed in PHP.

- When it is better to choose PHP over NodeJS
- What are the best PHP frameworks to work with React
- What are some overlooked features of PHP that makes it better (in some cases) than JS
- Reactifying old monsters (some ideas how to work with Wordpress and Drupal in React context)

Any secret that’s ever written to disk or on paper is another attack vector. Not just on production servers or continuous integration, but also in the developer workflow.

Mutual TLS is a good candidate for securing such communication. It provides proven encryption and individual devices can be identified and thus authenticated based on their certificates.

But handling a Private Key Infrastructure is not exactly known as a pleasant and simple task. Intimidating CLI tools like OpenSSL and a metric ton of documentation around all that can be more than overwhelming, even to the point of deciding: let's go for no security at all, that's simpler for sure.

This workshop will remove the cloak of complexity around Mutual TLS and present an understandable approach to building and maintaining your own PKI (in the cloud or on-premise) using Vault and some applied Ruby skills.

We will tackle common tasks like issuing and signing client/server certificates or handling and distributing those among clients and servers.

As software developers, our skills and ideas are increasingly crucial for keeping the world running. We don’t have time to test for, find, and fix all of the bugs.

",Talk (~40 mins on Saturday),Product Developement,How Unconscious Bias Affects Product Development & User Experience Design,"User experience design is one approach to addressing the issues of unconscious bias often found in today’s technology. Unconscious bias is an often overlooked and undervalued aspect of UX design since the little details seem to be so minor to us, however these minor details can have large and lasting impacts. Designing a user experience without paying attention to unconscious biases is leaving out small changes that, in turn, alienate large demographics of people and shrink your client base. On the other hand, making these small changes could be just the kickstart your product needs to expand and catch on within other demographics. This presentation will detail how to identify and overcome unconscious bias in order to achieve the maximum client or consumer base possible.

6/1/2017 20:29:36,Matt Stewart,hello@mattstewart.ca,Centre for Arts & Technology,Executive Success Coach,"

Matt Stewart is a no bullshit activator of potential. His No Excuses, Now What approach has been fostered & developed over the past 20+ years from coaching, collaborating and advising Senior Leaders across North America. In 2015 he said F U to Cancer and forged his own path and launched his proprietary no-holds-barred success coaching system. His foundational philosophy is boldly simple: move past the excuse —> laser focus on the next steps and you can accomplish a shit-tonne. The most important thing a leader, boss, manager or ANYONE can do is ask yourself “How Am I Framing This?”. How You Frame anything in life will impact the specific macro & micro-actions you take and will impact the tribes you choose to let into your life.

Matt’s approach is not some sit-around-a-campfire-hug-a tree-and-kiss-puppies kind of approach. It is based in the thought process that – no one owes you anything! This pragmatic whiskey-on-the-rocks approach has served Matt well during his years in Healthcare, the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, Finance and now as a Success Coach in post-secondary. Before venturing into the mountains of the Interior of BC – Matt also facilitated leadership training for the Toronto2015 Pan Am Games and taught in Tokyo Japan.

Remember —> Accept No Excuses and only ask Now What.

Instead focus and think of them as people; by coaching to develop their non-cognitive skills (aka soft skills.)
How much would your team/company be impacted if you hired graduates with strong interpersonal skills?
Could we do a better job preparing students for the soft skills gap of working in the real world? I argue we can and should.
The next generation doesn't want to be taught or told -> Could they be guided and coached towards their professional development?
What if your new hire understood how to give and receive behaviour based feedback?
What if your new hire was self aware of their conflict resolution style and could quickly and easily navigate thru various conflict resolution models? Then why not bring executive coaches into post secondary schools?

CSS Custom Properties are supported in all the major browsers and provide the ability to use the native CSS variables power, but still, have some restrictions- they are not animatable and cannot be used everywhere.
What if we have an ability to register the new CSS Custom property and set the behavior for it- from acceptable values, type, to the inheritance, behavior etc.?
Even though- declare for the browser how to process the variable, which will fully explain the name CSS CUSTOM Property.
And, if we went so far- let’s go further- take the control on Layout/Paint and Composite stages in the browser.
If you think it’s not possible, it’s time to learn Houdini Task Force achievements,
Which will provide all these abilities for developers.
It will solve the problem of polyfilling the new CSS properties or layouts (imagine, Grid layout polyfilled to all the browsers couple years ago, when the speck draft was just finished).
This can be used on the browser side as well- sticky header in Chrome is implemented using these specs.


Description/Summary:
Today CSS Custom Properties are supported in all the major browsers.
Now it’s time to do the next step- to have an ability to register new Custom Properties from JavaScript and setup the browser how to work with them (e.g. real CSS polyfills). They should work with the same performance as the native CSS properties, being animatable and aligned with CSSOM.
Custom Properties can be used as a bridge between CSS and JavaScript.
Houdini Task force introduces specs and JavaScript Worklets to expose the interaction with previously fully internal browser rendering mechanisms (during Paint, Layout, Composite stages).
All this brings Front-End development to the next level, parts of which are already available for the developers.

Anything the Program Committee needs to know?
As a participant of JS/CSS/HTML specs discussions, I have a significant experience and understanding why some solutions were made in some particular way and can highlight the details of the current state of the art on the bleeding edge of the Web technologies.
As the Houdini Task Forces started from the Google and then included other major browser developers and companies, the talk may be even more interested for the participants.",Intermediates,I am an experienced speaker.,No,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2an6ON6i3g&t=982s

That's where Apache Cordova/PhoneGap comes in by polyfilling the missing functionality. In this talk I'll show you how to create a PWA that runs on the web, Android and iOS from a single code base. Take advantage of some new tools to easily deploy and test your PWA.

I will begin with a brief overview of Progressive Web Apps, what features make your web app progressive and which API's you can take advantage of. Then I will discuss the availability of these API's on various platforms. Taking care not to completely dump on Apple for falling behind. No, that's a lie. I will jokingly take Apple to task.

Once the promise of PWA's has been illustrated and the problem of them not exactly being cross platform I will introduce Apache Cordova/PhoneGap, briefly, explaining how you can use Apache Cordova/PhoneGap to deploy a web application to Android and iOS. This will lead me into explaining how Cordova plugins allow us to polyfil the missing functionality on iOS.

A cute garden where Web Apps are grown with fun (and Ruby on Rails 5.1)

Every mature mobile app or responsive website needs a backend or Web App. There are many technologies you can use for that purpose. But only one of them found it's way into my Heart. Let me show you how much fun and productivity you can get while building a well tested Web App. Ruby on Rails lets you focus on things that matter instead of the boring ones. And with version 5.1 a much closer cooperation with your favourite frontend technology is now possible. It does not matter if you prefer jQuery, React, Angular or Dart. Or anything else. Rails will be happy to talk to everybody. Code is included!

When a Robot is smart enough?

Internet of Things (IoT) covers many areas, but the most interesting ones (at least for me) are Robotics and AI. Where is the moment when a machine or robot is ""smart enough""? Let's explore this area a bit together and let's see some examples. How difficult is to build a Smart Robot? Could you build one at home? The answer is Yes! And I will show you how. From the basic steps on #Arduino, to the beauty of more complex examples and solutions like SLAM, optical recognition, path finding or steering behaviours. Live demo is included!

Statistical data were migrated into HBase cluster where we implemented an aggregation and sorting system using HBase coprocessors and filters for mass statistical data aggregation and web-based viewing in real-tim. Data changes are tracked and stored in MongoDB cluster (MongoRocks) for the real-time historical reconstruction. Later the data are transformed into ORC format via our MongoDB connector and stored in Hadoop for more demanding analytics through Hive/Impala. Text phrases stored in MySQL, HBase, and MongoDB are indexed via SolrCloud.
