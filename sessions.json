We know what didn't work and using that knowledge we can improve next attempt. While failure is always an option (at least should be!), your job isn't the best place for failures. That's why I'd like to invite you to join Coding Dojo.\n\nCoding Dojo is a place for practice in a safe environment. You can fail, learn and repeat until you feel your skills are improved. This session would be held in order to practice Test Driven Development in pairs or small groups. No prior knowledge of TDD is required.",
